This repository contains the resource for the paper: *Acquiring Verb Classes Through Bottom-Up Semantic Verb Clustering.* Olga Majewska, Diana McCarthy, Ivan Vulić, and Anna Korhonen. Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC) 2018.

**Verb classes EN, PL, HR.xlsx**: contains semantic verb classes created for three languages, English, Polish, and Croatian. 

The classifications are a result of semantic clustering experiments with native speakers asked to classify a sample of 267 verbs into soft clusters based solely on their meaning (i.e. no reference to verbs' syntactic behaviour was required), aimed at verifying whether semantic verb classes can be reliably obtained from non-expert human annotators following simple instructions. 

The file contains multiple sheets, each containing semantic verb classes collected for a single annotator (numbered 1-3), for each language (EN-English, PL-Polish, and HR-Croatian). The first column contains class ID (number) and each row contains the members of a given class. The optional ‘Miscellaneous’ class can be found at the bottom (ID ‘Misc’).
